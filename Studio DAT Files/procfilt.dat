#
# This file specifies which process(es) are to be captured when an application 
# installation is being monitored.
#
# Entry format:
# {Process-Name} {Whether-To-Track-New-Child-Processes}
#
# NOTES: 
# 1) Information from this file does not get saved into the project. This file is 
#    loaded (or reloaded) every time a new caputure is initiated.
# 2) Each entry must be in one line.
# 3) Entries are case-insensitive.
# 4) Blank lines are ignored.
# 5) If process name contains white spaces, you must enclose the name in quotes.
# 6) If there is no entry specified in this file, all processes will be captured.
# 7) If there are some entries, each entry process and its new child processes 
#    (if so specified, note that existing child processes are always ignored), 
#
#    Additionally, the application's installer process and all of its child processes 
#    will also be captured.
#
# 8) If "SYSTEM" is specified in this file, the tracking will include System Process,
#    which is usually assigned PID == 4 for all Windows OSes. Note that the tracking
#    of this special process *does not* include its child processes (since System Process 
#    is an ancestor of all other processes in Windows). That means, the TRUE/FALSE
#    flag that follows "SYSTEM" on the line is ignored.

# System Process that creates certain registry keys when a Service/Driver is registered.
