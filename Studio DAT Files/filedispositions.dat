# File disposition filters to be applied at the end of capturing.
#
# Entry format:
# {file-or-folder-path} {disposition} {OPTIONAL:recursive}
#
# NOTES: 
# 1) Information from this file does not get saved into the project. This file is 
#    loaded (or reloaded) every time a new capture is initiated.
# 2) After the capture is merged to the workspace (STW), the entries in this file 
#    will be processed by the order of their appearing. 
#    - When there are multiple overlapping entries with conflicting specifications, 
#      the last one listed in this file will win.
#    - This processing affects only the newly captured items.
# 3) Each entry must be in one line.
# 4) Entries are case-insensitive.
# 5) Blank lines are ignored.
# 6) If a file or folder path contains white spaces, you must enclose the path in quotes (") 
#    and escape backslashes (\\)
# 7) {disposition} must be either 1, 2, 3, or 4.
# 8) {OPTIONAL:recursive} must be TRUE, FALSE or blank. Default: FALSE.
#
# OTHER NOTES:
# 1) If a path to be filtered has the Syswow64 counterpart, consider filtering 
#    the counterpart as well.
# 2) Paths under non-merged root folders can only be set to Layer 3 or 4.
#    - Settings that do not observe this rule will be ignored.
#    - Root folders not well-known to Windows are added as non-merged by default.
#      (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/shell/knownfolderid).
# 3) Paths under root folders of physical dispositions (Layer 1 or 2) can only be 
#    set to Layer 1 or 2.
#    - Settings that do not observe this rule will be ignored.

# C:\Windows\Fonts                                            1   FALSE
# %systemdrive%\Windows\Fonts                                 2             ///< Treated as FALSE (non-recursive)
# ?fonts?                                                     3   FALSE
# %systemroot%\Fonts                                          4   TRUE
# "C:\\My Folder\\My-File.txt"                                4
