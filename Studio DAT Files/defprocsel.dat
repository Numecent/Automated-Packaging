#
# This file specifies which processes are allowed or disallowed to access an 
# virtual application's name space. Allowed processes can select to access the 
# application's layer 4 files and keys even when the processes don't belong 
# to the virtual application. Disallowed processes cannot select to access the 
# application's layer 4 files and keys even when the processes belong to the 
# virtual application.
#
# Entry format:
# {Process-Name} {TRUE:allow-select|FALSE:disallow-select} [{TRUE:allow-read|FALSE:disallow-read|NEITHER:unknown-read}]
# - If setting for "read" is omitted, it is assumed to be NEITHER (no overwrite)
# - If setting for "select" is set to FALSE (disallowed), setting for "read" is ignored.
#
# NOTES: 
# 1) This file is loaded *once* every time a new project is created. Subsequently,
#    loaded information from this file will be saved with the new project. Reopening
#    an existing project will not reload this file and information will be reloaded 
#    from the saved project. In other words, changes to this file will affect only
#    future projects when they are created. Users can modify the list using the 
#    project view.
# 2) Each entry must be in one line.
# 3) Entries are case-insensitive.
# 4) Blank lines are ignored.
# 5) This file can be empty
# 6) If this file DOES NOT EXIST, the following entries are automatically included:
#    (Allowed for both "select" and "read"): 
#        CSRSS.EXE, 
#        AGENTSVR.EXE, 
#        SVCHOST.EXE, 
#        SERVICES.EXE, 
#        WINLOGON.EXE, 
#        CONSENT.EXE. 
#    (Denied for "select"): 
#        TRUSTEDINSTALLER.EXE.
# 7) For best compatility with older Player versions, either:
#    a) Delete this file; or
#    b) Specify the same items mentioned in #6.
